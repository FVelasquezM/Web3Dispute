# Web3Dispute

A simple experiment of a Web3 Dispute. 

Contains two Contracts, one for an evidence Smart Token NFT, and a second one for the Dispute Itself. 

Parts mint and submit evidence NFTs to the dispute, which is resolved in favour of one, or both, of the parts, dispersing the disputed funds.
